# Application-scoring-model (WIP)
## Authors: Kholinov Roman Andreevich, Lebedinsky Andrey Vladimirovich
## Project Superviser: Vorobyova Maria Sergeevna  
Project stages:
1) Exploratory data analysis - Analysis of given variables, their type, ranges and quality and distribution.
2) Data preparation & preprocessing - Normalization, dealing with NaNs variables, dropping unnecessary variables, etc.
3) Additional variables creation - Engineering new features based on the previous analysis & assumptions.
4) WOE - Applying Weight of Evidence transformation method for independent variables.
5) Segmentation analysis - Identifying segmentation methods most appropriate for our task
6) Constructing & tuning the models - Fit and optimize chosen models by calibrating the parameters
7) Interpretation of the results - Examine the results, determine the rational behind the results
8) Conclusion - Writhe a comprehensive recommendation list based on the models results
